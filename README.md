# tally

Keep count of your score (can be anything) and see how you fare against other people in the server. Now you can track multiple scores!

Do you want to keep track of your kills and compare with your friends? Or how many words you've written? Or how many special items you have? Or maybe all three?

Add, view or reset your contribution to a category using the commands /add, /view-p, or /reset.
Check the leaderboard of a category using /leaderboard.
View how much all the members of a server have contributed to each category as a whole using /view-s.

Admins can add, remove, or reset categories.

The server owner is a permanent admin. By default, the top role at the moment the bot is added is set to be the mod role.
